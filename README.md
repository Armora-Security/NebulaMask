## üìå Introduction

**Armora NebulaMask** is a high-performance load balancer written in Go (Golang), designed to efficiently route traffic across multiple backend servers. This tool supports:

- **Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirection**
- **Round Robin** traffic distribution
- Periodic **health checks** on backend services
- Support for up to **10 backend servers**
- Easy configuration via YAML file
- SSL/TLS termination support

It's ideal for environments where simplicity, reliability, and performance are key.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Architecture Overview
Client --> [Port 80 (HTTP)] --(Redirect to HTTPS)--> [Port 443 (HTTPS)] | ‚Üì [Backend Servers] (Up to 10 backend nodes with health monitoring)


### Core Features

- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming requests using round-robin algorithm.
- **Health Monitoring**: Pings each backend at configurable intervals to determine availability.
- **Secure by Default**: Built-in support for TLS termination using provided certificates.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and resource-efficient.

---

## üß™ Requirements

- Go 1.22+ (for building from source)
- Valid SSL certificate (`cert.pem` and `key.pem`)
- Backend servers running and responding to `/health` endpoint

---

## üìÅ Configuration Example (`config.yaml`)

```yaml
server:
  http_port: 80
  https_port: 443

ssl:
  enabled: true
  cert_file: "cert.pem"
  key_file: "key.pem"

backends:
  - name: "server-1"
    url: "http://127.0.0.1:3001"
    health_check_path: "/health"
    interval_sec: 5

  - name: "server-2"
    url: "http://127.0.0.1:3002"
    health_check_path: "/health"
    interval_sec: 5

  - name: "server-3"
    url: "http://127.0.0.1:3003"
    health_check_path: "/health"
    interval_sec: 5

  - name: "server-4"
    url: "http://127.0.0.1:3004"
    health_check_path: "/health"
    interval_sec: 5

  - name: "server-5"
    url: "http://127.0.0.1:3005"
    health_check_path: "/health"
    interval_sec: 5

  - name: "server-6"
    url: "http://127.0.0.1:3006"
    health_check_path: "/health"
    interval_sec: 5

  - name: "server-7"
    url: "http://127.0.0.1:3007"
    health_check_path: "/health"
    interval_sec: 5

  - name: "server-8"
    url: "http://127.0.0.1:3008"
    health_check_path: "/health"
    interval_sec: 5

  - name: "server-9"
    url: "http://127.0.0.1:3009"
    health_check_path: "/health"
    interval_sec: 5

  - name: "server-10"
    url: "http://127.0.0.1:3010"
    health_check_path: "/health"
    interval_sec: 5

```
